An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:
<ul>
  <li> The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.</li>
     </ul>
   </ul>
</ul>
This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years. Source

<h2> Task </h2>

Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.

<h2> Input Format </h2>

Read year, the year to test.

<h2> Constraints </h2>

1900 <= year <= 10^5

<h2> Output Format </h2>

The function must return a Boolean value (True/False). Output is handled by the provided code stub.

<h2> Sample Input 0 </h2>

1990
<h2> Sample Output 0 </h2>

False
